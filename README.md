"Real-Time Face Recognition with Python, Firebase, OpenCV, SQL, and Numpy"

This Git repository hosts a comprehensive solution 
for real-time face recognition utilizing Python along with Firebase, OpenCV, SQL, Numpy, and other essential libraries. 
The system allows users to securely authenticate themselves by presenting their faces, with their facial data stored in a database.
Upon successful recognition, their attendance is automatically marked in real-time and updated accordingly.

Key Features:

Facial Recognition: Leveraging OpenCV for real-time face detection and recognition.
Database Integration: Utilizing SQL databases to store and manage user facial data securely.
Firebase Integration: Seamless integration with Firebase for user authentication and data management.
Attendance Tracking: Automatic attendance marking upon successful face recognition.
Time-Based Attendance Limitation: Users can only mark their attendance once within a set time interval,
typically 24 hours, controlled by the code configuration.
With this repository, users can implement a robust and efficient real-time face recognition system
with added attendance tracking capabilities, suitable for various applications requiring secure and accurate identification.
